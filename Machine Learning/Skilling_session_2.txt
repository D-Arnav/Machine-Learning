Skilling Question 3 (extension to skill Question 1): 

- Design a database of 20 points, L = 2 and M = 1.

- Design a polynomial regression with order P = 1.

- Get optimal modal parameters (where Ew is minimum) using Stochastic Gradient Descent method

- Plot the data points and model function



Skilling Question 4 (extension to skill Question 2): 

- Use the Data.csv file attached

- Design a Ridge regression with order P = 9 (where there is an overfitting, when used a polynomial regression)

- Experiment with various tuning parameters lamda

- Consider 80 % of data points for training and 20 % for testing

- Plot the Ew for training and testing data for different values of tuning parameters


Skilling Question 5:

- Using your own data implement a two class linear classifier

- Use standard LSM approach

- Plot the data points and the discriminant function


Skilling Question 6:

- Using your own data implement a two class linear classifier using the Logistic Regression approach

- Get optimal modal parameters (where Ew is minimum) using Stochastic Gradient Descent method

- Plot the data points and the discriminant function
