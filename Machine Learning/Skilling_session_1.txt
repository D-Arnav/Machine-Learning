Skilling Question 1: 

- Design a database of 20 points, L = 2 and M = 1.

- Design a polynomial regression with order P = 1.

- Get optimal modal parameters (where Ew is minimum) using standard least squares method

- Plot the data points and model function



Skilling Question 2: 

- Use the Data.csv file attached

- Design a polynomial regression with orders P = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.

- Consider 80 % of data points for training and 20 % for testing

- Plot the Ew for training and testing data for different orders
